# ## Objectives 
#
# In this lab, you will investigate the transition to chaos in the Lorenz
# equations – a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations.
# Using interactive examples, and analytical and numerical techniques, you
# will determine the stability of the solutions to the system, and
# discover a rich variety in their behaviour. You will program both an
# adaptive and non-adaptive Runge-Kuttan code for the problem, and
# determine the relative merits of each.
#

#
# ## Readings
#
# There is no required reading for this lab, beyond the contents of the
# lab itself. Nevertheless, the original 1963 paper by Lorenz  is
# worthwhile reading from a historical standpoint.
#
# If you would like additional background on any of the following topics,
# then refer to Appendix B for the following:
#
# -   **Easy Reading:**
#
#     -   Gleick  (1987) [pp. 9-31], an interesting overview of the
#         science of chaos (with no mathematical details), and a look at
#         its history.

#
# ##  Introduction 
#
#
# For many people working in the physical sciences, the *butterfly
# effect* is a well-known phrase. But even if you are unacquainted
# with the term, its consequences are something you are intimately
# familiar with. Edward Lorenz investigated the feasibility of performing
# accurate, long-term weather forecasts, and came to the conclusion that
# *even something as seemingly insignificant as the flap of a
# butterfly’s wings can have an influence on the weather on the other side
# of the globe*. This implies that global climate modelers must
# take into account even the tiniest of variations in weather conditions
# in order to have even a hope of being accurate. Some of the models used
# today in weather forecasting have up to *a million unknown
# variables!*
#
# With the advent of modern computers, many people believed that accurate
# predictions of systems as complicated as the global weather were
# possible. Lorenz’ studies (Lorenz, 1963), both analytical and numerical, were
# concerned with simplified models for the flow of air in the atmosphere.
# He found that even for systems with considerably fewer variables than
# the weather, the long-term behaviour of solutions is intrinsically
# unpredictable. He found that this type of non-periodic, or
# *chaotic* behaviour, appears in systems that are described
# by non-linear differential equations.
#
# The atmosphere is just one of many hydrodynamical systems, which exhibit
# a variety of solution behaviour: some flows are steady; others oscillate
# between two or more states; and still others vary in an irregular or
# haphazard manner. This last class of behaviour in a fluid is known as
# *turbulence*, or in more general systems as
# *chaos*. Examples of chaotic behaviour in physical systems
# include
#
# -   thermal convection in a tank of fluid, driven by a heated plate on
#     the bottom, which displays an irregular patter of “convection rolls”
#     for certain ranges of the temperature gradient;
#
# -   a rotating cylinder, filled with fluid, that exhibits
#     regularly-spaced waves or irregular, nonperiodic flow patterns under
#     different conditions;
#
# -   the Lorenzian water wheel, a mechanical system, described in
#     [Appendix A](#sec_water-wheel).
#
#

# %% [markdown]
# One of the simplest systems to exhibit chaotic behaviour is a system of
# three ordinary differential equations, studied by Lorenz, and which are
# now known as the *Lorenz equations* (see
# equations ([eq: lorentz](#eq_lorentz)). They are an idealization of
# a more complex hydrodynamical system of twelve equations describing
# turbulent flow in the atmosphere, but which are still able to capture
# many of the important aspects of the behaviour of atmospheric flows. The
# Lorenz equations determine the evolution of a system described by three
# time-dependent state variables, $x(t)$, $y(t)$ and $z(t)$. The state in
# Lorenz’ idealized climate at any time, $t$, can be given by a single
# point, $(x,y,z)$, in *phase space*. As time varies, this
# point moves around in the phase space, and traces out a curve, which is
# also called an *orbit* or *trajectory*. 
#
# The video below shows an animation of the 3-dimensional phase space trajectories
# of $x, y, z$ for the Lorenz equations presented below.  It is calculated with
# the python script by written by Jake VanderPlas: [lorenz_ode.py](https://github.com/phaustin/numeric/blob/lab6/lab6/lorenz_ode.py)

# ## Using the Integrator class

# %% [markdown]
#  [lorenz_ode.py](https://github.com/phaustin/numeric/blob/lab6/lab6/lorenz_ode.py) uses the
#  odeint package from scipy.  That's fine if we are happy with a black box, but we
#  can also use the Integrator class from lab 5.   Here is the sub-class Integrator61 
#  that is specified for the Lorenz equations:

            [self.initvars.x, self.initvars.y, self.initvars.z])
        self.nvars = len(self.yinit)
    
    def derivs5(self, coords, t):
        x,y,z = coords
        u=self.uservars
        f=np.empty_like(coords)
        f[0] = u.sigma * (y - x)
        f[1] = x * (u.rho - z) - y
        f[2] = x * y - u.beta * z
        return f

# As you saw in the movie, the behaviour of the solution, even though it
# seems to be confined to a specific surface, is anything but regular. The
# solution seems to loop around and around forever, oscillating around one
# of the wings, and then jump over to the other one, with no apparent
# pattern to the number of revolutions. This example is computed for just
# one choice of parameter values, and you will see in the problems later
# on in this lab, that there are many other types of solution behaviour.
# In fact, there are several very important characteristics of the
# solution to the Lorenz equations which parallel what happens in much
# more complicated systems such as the atmosphere:
#
# 1.  The solution remains within a bounded region (that is, none of the
#     values of the solution “blow up”), which means that the solution
#     will always be physically reasonable.
#
# 2.  The solution flips back and forth between the two wings of the
#     butterfly diagram, with no apparent pattern. This “strange” way that
#     the solution is attracted towards the wings gives rise to the name
#     <span>*strange attractor*</span>.
#
# 3.  The resulting solution depends very heavily on the given initial
#     conditions. Even a very tiny change in one of the initial values can
#     lead to a solution which follows a totally different trajectory, if
#     the system is integrated over a long enough time interval.
#
# 4.  The solution is irregular or <span>*chaotic*</span>, meaning that it
#     is impossible, based on parameter values and initial conditions
#     (which may contain small measurement errors), to predict the
#     solution at any future time.

# ##  The Lorenz Equations 
#
#
# As mentioned in the previous section, the equations we will be
# considering in this lab model an idealized hydrodynamical system:
# two-dimensional convection in a tank of water which is heated at the
# bottom (as pictured in [Figure Convection](#fig_convection) below).
#
# <div id="fig_convection"></div>

# %%
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename="images/convection.png")

# %% [markdown]
# **Figure Convection** Lorenz studied the flow of fluid in a tank heated at the bottom, which
# results in “convection rolls”, where the warm fluid rises, and the cold
# fluid is drops to the bottom.
#
# Lorenz wrote the equations in the form
#
# <!-- \label{lab6:eq:lorenz} -->
#
# <div id="eq_lorenz"></div>
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
#   \frac{dx}{dt} &=& \sigma(y-x)  \\
#   \frac{dy}{dt} &=& \rho x-y-xz  \\
#   \frac{dz}{dt} &=& xy-\beta z 
# \end{aligned}
# $$
# where $\sigma$, $\rho$
# and $\beta$ are real, positive parameters. The variables in the problem can
# be interpreted as follows:
#
# -   $x$ is proportional to the intensity of the convective motion (positive
#     for clockwise motion, and a larger magnitude indicating more
#     vigorous circulation),
#
# -   $y$ is proportional to the temperature difference between the ascending
#     and descending currents (it’s positive if the warm water is on the
#     bottom),
#
# -   $z$ is proportional to the distortion of the vertical temperature
#     profile from linearity (a value of 0 corresponds to a linear
#     gradient in temperature, while a positive value indicates that the
#     temperature is more uniformly mixed in the middle of the tank and
#     the strongest gradients occur near the boundaries),
#
# -   $t$ is the dimensionless time,
#
# -   $\sigma$ is called the Prandtl number (it involves the viscosity and thermal
#     conductivity of the fluid),
#
# -   $\rho$ is a control parameter, representing the temperature difference
#     between the top and bottom of the tank, and
#
# -   $\beta$ measures the width-to-height ratio of the convection layer.

# %% [markdown]
# Notice that these equations are *non-linear* in $x$, $y$
# and $z$, which is a result of the non-linearity of the fluid flow
# equations from which this simplified system is obtained.
#
# **Mathematical Note**: This system of equations is derived by Saltzman (1962) for the
# thermal convection problem. However, the same
# equations ([eq:lorenz](#eq_lorenz)) arise in other physical
# systems as well. One example is the whose advantage over the original
# derivation by Saltzman (which is also used in Lorenz’ 1963 paper ) is
# that the system of ODEs is obtained *directly from the
# physics*, rather than as an approximation to a partial
# differential equation.
#
# Remember from Section [lab6:sec:intro] that the Lorenz equations exhibit
# nonperiodic solutions which behave in a chaotic manner. Using analytical
# techniques, it is actually possible to make some qualitative predictions
# about the behaviour of the solution before doing any computations.
# However, before we move on to a discussion of the stability of the
# problem in Section [lab6:sec:stability], you should do the following
# exercise, which will give you a hands-on introduction to the behaviour
# of solutions to the Lorenz equations.
#
# <div id="prob_experiment"></div>
#
# [Problem Experiment](#prob_experiment) Lorenz’ results are based on the following values
# of the physical parameters taken from Saltzman’s paper (Saltzman, 1962):
# $$\sigma=10 \quad \mathrm{and} \quad b=\frac{8}{3}.$$ As you will see
# in [Section stability](#sec_stability), there is a *critical value of the
# parameter $\rho$*, $\rho^\ast=470/19\approx 24.74$ (for these values of
# $\sigma$ and $\beta$); it is *critical* in the sense that for
# any value of $\rho>\rho^\ast$, the flow is unstable.
#
# To allow you to investigate the behaviour of the solution to the Lorenz
# equations, you can try out various parameter values in the following
# interactive example. *Initially, leave $\sigma$ and $\beta$ alone, and
# modify only $\rho$ and the initial conditions.* If you have time,
# you can try varying the other two parameters, and see what happens. Here
# are some suggestions:
#
# -   Fix the initial conditions at $(5,5,5)$ and vary $\rho$ between $0$ and
#     $100$.
#
# -   Fix $\rho=28$, and vary the initial conditions; for example, try
#     $(0,0,0)$, $(0.1,0.1,0.1)$, $(0,0,20)$, $(100,100,100)$,
#     $(8.5,8.5,27)$, etc.
#
# -   Anything else you can think of …
#
# 1.  Describe the different types of behaviour you see and compare them
#     to what you saw in [Figure fixed-plot](#fig_fixed-plot). Also, discuss the
#     results in terms of what you read in [Section Introduction](#sec_introduction)
#     regarding the four properties of the solution.
#
# 2.  One question you should be sure to ask yourself is: *Does
#     changing the initial condition affect where the solution ends
#     up?* The answer to this question will indicate whether there
#     really is an attractor which solutions approach as
#     $t\rightarrow\infty$.
#
# 3.  Finally, for the different types of solution behaviour, can you
#     interpret the results physically in terms of the thermal convection
#     problem?
#  
# Now, we’re ready to find out why the solution behaves as it does. In
# [Section Intro](#sec_introduction), you were told about four properties of
# solutions to the Lorenz equations that are also exhibited by the
# atmosphere, and in the problem you just worked though, you saw that
# these were also exhibited by solutions to the Lorenz equations. In the
# remainder of this section, you will see mathematical reasons for two of
# those characteristics, namely the boundedness and stability (or
# instability) of solutions.
#
#

# %% [markdown]
#
# <div id="sec_boundedness"></div>
#
# ##  Boundedness of the Solution
#
#
# The easiest way to see that the solution is bounded in time is by
# looking at the motion of the solution in phase space, $(x,y,z)$, as the
# flow of a fluid, with velocity $(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z})$ (the “dot”
# is used to represent a time derivative, in order to simplify notation in
# what follows). The *divergence of this flow* is given by
# $$\frac{\partial \dot{x}}{\partial x} +
#   \frac{\partial \dot{y}}{\partial y} +
#   \frac{\partial \dot{z}}{\partial z},$$ and measures how the volume of
# a fluid particle or parcel changes – a positive divergence means that
# the fluid volume is increasing locally, and a negative volume means that
# the fluid volume is shrinking locally (zero divergence signifies an
# *incompressible fluid*, which you will see more of in and
# ). If you look back to the Lorenz
# equations ([eq:lorenz](#eq_lorenz)), and take partial derivatives,
# it is clear that the divergence of this flow is given by
# $$
# \frac{\partial \dot{x}}{\partial x} +
# \frac{\partial \dot{y}}{\partial y} +
# \frac{\partial \dot{z}}{\partial z} = -(\sigma + b + 1).
# $$
# Since
# $\sigma$ and $b$ are both positive, real constants, the divergence is a
# negative number, which is always less than $-1$. Therefore, each small
# volume shrinks to zero as the time $t\rightarrow\infty$, at a rate which
# is independent of $x$, $y$ and $z$. The consequence for the solution,
# $(x,y,z)$, is that every trajectory in phase space is eventually
# confined to a region of zero volume. As you saw in
# [Problem experiment](#prob_experiment), this region, or
# *attractor*, need not be a point – in fact, the two wings
# of the “butterfly diagram” are a surface with zero volume.
#
# The most important consequence of the solution being bounded is that
# none of the physical variables, $x$, $y$, or $z$ “blows up.”
# Consequently, we can expect that the solution will remain with
# physically reasonable limits.
#

#
# <div id="sec_steady"></div>
#
# ## Steady States 
#
#
# A *steady state* of a system is a point in phase space from
# which the system will not change in time, once that state has been
# reached. In other words, it is a point, $(x,y,z)$, such that the
# solution does not change, or where
# $$\frac{dx}{dt} = 0  \quad\  \mathrm{and}\ \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \quad
#   \ \mathrm{and}\ \quad \frac{dz}{dt} = 0.$$ This point is usually
# referred to as a *stationary point* of the system.
#
# <div id="prob_steady-states"></div>
# **[Problem steady-states](#prob_steady-states)** Set the time derivatives equal to zero in the
# Lorenz equations ([eq:lorenz](#eq_lorenz)), and solve the
# resulting system to show that there are three possible steady states,
# namely the points
#
# -   $(0,0,0)$,
#
# -   $(\sqrt{\beta(\rho-1)},\sqrt{\beta(\rho -1)},\rho -1)$, and
#
# -   $(-\sqrt{\beta (\rho -1)},-\sqrt{\beta(\rho-1)},\rho-1)$.
#
# Remember that $\rho$ is a positive real number, so that that there is
# *only one* stationary point when $0\leq \rho \leq 1$, but all
# three stationary points are present when $\rho >1$.
#
# While working through [Problem experiment](#prob_experiment), did you notice the
# change in behaviour of the solution as $\rho$ passes through the value 1?
# If not, then go back to the interactive example and try out some values
# of $\rho$ both less than and greater than 1 to see how the solution
# changes.
#
# A steady state tells us the behaviour of the solution only at a single
# point. *But what happens to the solution if it is perturbed
# slightly away from a stationary point? Will it return to the stationary
# point; or will it tend to move away from the point; or will it oscillate
# about the steady state; or something else … ?* All of these
# questions are related to the long-term, *asymptotic*
# behaviour or *stability* of the solution near a given
# point. You already should have seen some examples of different
# asymptotic solution behaviour in the Lorenz equations for different
# parameter values. The next section describes a general method for
# determining the stability of a solution near a given stationary point.

# <div id="sec_linearization"></div>
#
# ## Linearization about the Steady States 
#
#
# The difficult part of doing any theoretical analysis of the Lorenz
# equations is that they are *non-linear*. *So, why not
# approximate the non-linear problem by a linear one?*
#
# This idea should remind you of what you read about Taylor series in
# Lab \#2. There, we were approximating a function, $f(x)$, around a point
# by expanding the function in a Taylor series, and the first order Taylor
# approximation was simply a linear function in $x$. The approach we will
# take here is similar, but will get into Taylor series of functions of
# more than one variable: $f(x,y,z,\dots)$.
#
# The basic idea is to replace the right hand side functions in
# ([eq:lorenz](#eq_lorenz)) with a linear approximation about a
# stationary point, and then solve the resulting system of *linear
# ODE’s*. Hopefully, we can then say something about the non-linear
# system at values of the solution *close to the stationary
# point* (remember that the Taylor series is only accurate close to
# the point we’re expanding about).
#
# So, let us first consider the stationary point $(0,0,0)$. If we
# linearize a function $f(x,y,z)$ about $(0,0,0)$ we obtain the
# approximation: 
#
# $$f(x,y,z) \approx f(0,0,0) + f_x(0,0,0) \cdot (x-0) + 
# f_y(0,0,0) \cdot (y-0) + f_z(0,0,0) \cdot (z-0).$$ 
#
# If we apply this
# formula to the right hand side function for each of the ODE’s in
# ([eq: lorenz](#eq_lorenz)), then we obtain the following linearized
# system about $(0,0,0)$: 
#
# <!-- \label{lab6:eq:lorenz-linear0} -->

# <div id="eq_lorenz_linear"></div>
#
# \begin{aligned}
# \label{eq:lorenz_linear}
#   \frac{dx}{dt} &= -\sigma x + \sigma y \\
#   \frac{dy}{dt} &= \rho x-y   \\
#   \frac{dz}{dt} &= -\beta z  
# \end{aligned}
#
#
# (note that each right
# hand side is now a linear function of $x$, $y$ and $z$). It is helpful
# to write this system in matrix form as
#
# <!--   \label{lab6:eq:lorenz-linear0-matrix} -->
#
# <div id="eq_lorenz_linear_matrix"></div>

# \begin{aligned}
# \label{eq:lorenz_linear_matrix}

#   \begin{array}{c} x \\ y \\ z \end{array} \right)  = 
#   \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
#     -\sigma & \sigma & 0 \\
#     \rho & -1 & 0 \\
#     0 & 0 & -\beta 
#   \end{array} \right) \;
#       \left(\begin{array}{c} x \\ y \\ z \end{array} \right)
# \end{aligned}
#
#
# the reason for
# this being that the *eigenvalues* of the matrix give us
# valuable information about the solution to the linear system. In fact,
# it is a well-known result from the study of dynamical systems is that if
# the matrix in (\ref{eq:lorenz_linear_matrix}) has
# *distinct* eigenvalues $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ and
# $\lambda_3$, then the solution to this equation is given by
#
# <!-- \label{lab6:eq:xsolution}$$  -->
#
# $$
# x(t) = c_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} + c_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} + c_3 e^{\lambda_3 t},
# $$
# and similarly for the other two solution
# components, $y(t)$ and $z(t)$ (the $c_i$’s are constants that are
# determined by the initial conditions of the problem). This should not
# seem too surprising, if you think that the solution to the scalar
# equation $dx/dt=\lambda x$ is $x(t) = e^{\lambda t}$.

#
# ###  Stability of the Linearized Problem
#
#
# Now that we know the eigenvalues of the system around each stationary
# point, we can write down the solution to the linearized problem.
# However, it is not the exact form of the linearized solution that we’re
# interested in, but rather its *stability*. In fact, the
# eigenvalues give us all the information we need to know about how the
# linearized solution behaves in time, and so we’ll only talk about the
# eigenvalues from now on.
#
# It is possible that two of the eigenvalues in
# the characteristic equations above can
# be complex numbers – *what does this mean for the solution?* The details are a bit
# involved, but the important thing to realize is that if
# $\lambda_2,\lambda_3=a\pm i\beta$ are complex (remember that complex roots
# always occur in conjugate pairs) then the solutions can be rearranged so
# that they are of the form
#
# <!-- \label{lab6:eq:xsolution2} -->
# $$
# x(t) = c_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} + c_2 e^{a t} \cos(bt) + c_3 e^{a t}
#   \sin(bt). 
#  $$ 
# In terms of the asymptotic
# stability of the problem, we need to look at the asymptotic behaviour of
# the solution as $t\rightarrow \infty$, from
# which several conclusions can be drawn:
#
# 1.  If the eigenvalues are *real and negative*, then the
#     solution will go to zero as $t \rightarrow\infty$. In this case the
#     linearized solution is *stable*.
#
# 2.  If the eigenvalues are real, and *at least one* is
#     positive, then the solution will blow up as $t \rightarrow\infty$.
#     In this case the linearized solution is *unstable*.
#
# 3.  If there is a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues, $a\pm ib$, then
#     the solution exhibits oscillatory behaviour (with the appearance of
#     the terms $\sin{bt}$ and $\cos{bt}$). If the real part, $a$, of all
#     eigenvalues is negative, the oscillations will decay in time and the
#     solution is *stable*; if the real part is positive,
#     then the oscillations will grow, and the solution is
#     *unstable*. If the complex eigenvalues have zero real
#     part, then the oscillations will neither decay nor increase in time
#     – the resulting linearized problem is periodic, and we say the
#     solution is *marginally stable*.
#
# Now, an important question:
#
# *Does the stability of the non-linear system parallel that of the linearized systems near the stationary points?*
#
# The answer is “almost always”. We won’t go into why, or why not, but
# just remember that you can usually expect the non-linear system to
# behave just as the linearized system near the stationary states.
#
#

# %% [markdown]
# The discussion of stability of the stationary points for the Lorenz
# equations will be divided up based on values of the parameter $\rho$
# (assuming $\sigma=10$ and $\beta=\frac{8}{3}$). You’ve already seen that the
# behaviour of the solution changes significantly, by the appearance of
# two additional stationary points, when $r$ passes through the value 1.
# You’ll also see an explanation for the rest of the behaviour you
# observed:
#
# $0<\rho<1$:
#
# -   there is only one stationary state, namely the point $(0,0,0)$. You
#     can see from (\ref{eq:eig0}) that for these values of
#     $\rho$, there are three, real, negative roots. The origin is a
#     *stable* stationary point; that is, it attracts nearby
#     solutions to itself.
#
# $\rho>1$:
#
# -  The origin has one positive, and two negative, real eigenvalues.
#     Hence, the origin is *unstable*. Now, we need only look
#     at the other two stationary points, whose behaviour is governed by
#     the roots of (\ref{eq:eig12})
#
# $1<\rho<\frac{470}{19}$:
#
# -   The other two stationary points have eigenvalues that have negative
#     real parts. So these two points are *stable*.
#
#     It’s also possible to show that two of these eigenvalues are real
#     when $\rho<1.346$, and they are complex otherwise (see Sparrow 1982
#     for a more complete discussion). Therefore, the solution begins to
#     exhibit oscillatory behaviour beyond a value of $\rho$ greater than
#     1.346.
#
# $\rho>\frac{470}{19}$:
#
# -   The other two stationary points have one real, negative eigenvalue,
#     and two complex eigenvalues with positive real part. Therefore,
#     these two points are *unstable*. In fact, all three
#     stationary points are unstable for these values of $\rho$.
#
# The stability of the stationary points is summarized in table below.

# - Summary of the stability of the stationary points for the Lorenz
#   equations; parameters $\sigma=10$, $\beta=\frac{8}{3}$
#
#
# This “critical value” of $\rho^\ast= \frac{470}{19}$ is actually found
# using the formula $$\rho^\ast= \frac{\sigma(\sigma+\beta+3)}{\sigma-\beta-1}.$$ See
# Sparrow (1982) for more details.
#
# A qualitative change in behaviour of in the solution when a parameter is
# varied is called a *bifurcation*. Bifurcations occur at:
#
# -   $\rho=1$, when the origin switches from stable to unstable, and two
#     more stationary points appear.
#
# -   $\rho=\rho^\ast$, where the remaining two stationary points switch from
#     being stable to unstable.
#
# Remember that the linear results apply only near the stationary points,
# and do not apply to all of the phase space. Nevertheless, the behaviour
# of the orbits near these points can still say quite a lot about the
# behaviour of the solutions.

# **Problem Stability** Based on the analytical results from this section,
# you can now go back to your results from [Problem Experiment](#prob_experiment)
# and look at them in a new light. Write a short summary of your results
# (including a few plots or sketches), describing how the solution changes
# with $\rho$ in terms of the existence and stability of the stationary
# points.
#
# There have already been hints at problems with the linear stability
# analysis. One difficulty that hasn’t been mentioned yet is that for
# values of $\rho>\rho^\ast$, the problem has oscillatory solutions, which are
# unstable. *Linear theory does not reveal what happens when these
# oscillations become large!* In order to study more closely the
# long-time behaviour of the solution, we must turn to numerical
# integration (in fact, all of the plots you produced in
# Problem [lab6:prob:experiment] were generated using a numerical code).

#
# ## Numerical Integration 
#
# In Lorenz’ original paper, he discusses the application of the forward
# Euler and leap frog time-stepping schemes, but his actual computations
# are done using the second order <span>*Heun’s method*</span> (you were
# introduced to this method in Lab \#4. Since we already have a lot of
# experience with Runge-Kutta methods for systems of ODE’s from earlier
# labs, you’ll be using this approach to solve the Lorenz equations as
# well. You already have a code from that solves the Daisy World
# equations, so you can jump right into the programming for the Lorenz
# equations with the following exercises …
#
# <div id="prob_adaptive"></div>
#
# **Problem Adaptive:**  You saw in that adaptive time-stepping saved a
# considerable amount of computing time for the Daisy World problem. In
# this problem, you will be investigating whether or not an adaptive
# Runge-Kutta code is the best choice for the Lorenz equations.
#
# Use the Integrator61 object to compute in both adaptive and
# fixed timeloop solutions for an extended integration. 
# Compare the number of time steps taken (plot the
# time step vs. the integration time for both methods). Which method is
# more efficient?  Which is fastest?  A simple way to time a portion of
# a script is to use the ```time``` module to calculate the elapsed time:
#
# ```
# import time
# tic = time.time()
# ##program here
# elapsed = time.time() - tic
# ```
#
# To answer this last question, you will have to consider the cost of the
# adaptive scheme, compared to the non-adaptive one. The adaptive scheme
# is obviously more expensive, but by how much? You should think in terms
# of the number of multiplicative operations that are required in every
# time step for each method. You don’t have to give an exact operation
# count, round figures will do.
#
# Finally, we mentioned that the code that produced the animation uses
# a C module called odeint.   It is called [here](https://github.com/phaustin/numeric/blob/lab6/lab6/lorenz_ode.py#L22-L23) using derivatives defined in 
# [lorenz_deriv](https://github.com/phaustin/numeric/blob/lab6/lab6/lorenz_ode.py#L11-L14).
# Use odeint to solve the same problem you did for the fixed and adaptive
# timeloops.  What is the speed increase you see by using the compiled module?
#
#
#
# <div id="prob_sensitivity"></div>
#
# **Problem Sensitivity**: One property of chaotic systems such as the
# Lorenz equations is their *sensitivity to initial
# conditions* – a consequence of the “butterfly effect.” Modify
# your code from [Problem adaptive](#prob_adaptive) to compute two trajectories
# (in the chaotic regime $r>r^\ast$) with different initial conditions
# *simultaneously*. Use two initial conditions that are very
# close to each other, say $(1,1,20)$ and $(1,1,20.001)$. Use your “method
# of choice” (adaptive/non-adaptive), and plot the distance between the
# two trajectories as a function of time. What do you see?
#
# One important limitation of numerical methods is immediately evident
# when approximating non-periodic dynamical systems such as the Lorenz
# equations: namely, *every computed solution is periodic*.
# That is, when we’re working in floating point arithmetic, there are only
# finitely many numbers that can be represented, and the solution must
# eventually repeat itself. When using single precision arithmetic, a
# typical computer can represent many more floating point numbers than we
# could ever perform integration steps in a numerical scheme. However, it
# is still possible that round-off error might introduce a periodic orbit
# in the numerical solution where one does not really exist. In our
# computations, this will not be a factor, but it is something to keep in
# mind.

#
# ## Other Chaotic Systems
#
#
# There are many other ODE systems that exhibit chaos. An example is one
# studied by Rössler, which obeys a similar-looking system of three ODE’s:
#
# <!-- \label{lab6:eq:rossler} -->
#
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
#   \dot{x}&=&-y-z  \\ 
#   \dot{y}&=&x+ay  \\
#   \dot{z}&=&b+z(x-c) 
#   \end{aligned}
#  $$ 
#
# Suppose that $b=2$, $c=4$,
# and consider the behaviour of the attractor as $a$ is varied. When $a$
# is small, the attractor is a simple closed curve. As $a$ is increased,
# however, this splits into a double loop, then a quadruple loop, and so
# on. Thus, a type of *period-doubling* takes place, and when
# $a$ reaches about 0.375, there is a fractal attractor in the form of a
# band, that looks something like what is known in mathematical circles as
# a *Möbius strip*.
#
# If you’re really keen on this topic, you might be interested in using
# your code to investigate the behaviour of this system of equations,
# *though you are not required to hand anything in for this!*
#
# First, you could perform a stability analysis for
# ([lab6:eq:rossler]), like you saw above for the Lorenz
# equations. Then, modify your code to study the Rössler attractor. Use
# the code to compare your analytical stability results to what you
# actually see in the computations.

#
# ## Summary 
#
# In this lab, you have had the chance to investigate the solutions to the
# Lorenz equations and their stability in quite some detail. You saw that
# for certain parameter values, the solution exhibits non-periodic,
# chaotic behaviour. The question to ask ourselves now is: *What
# does this system tell us about the dynamics of flows in the
# atmosphere?* In fact, this system has been simplified so much
# that it is no longer an accurate model of the physics in the atmosphere.
# However, we have seen that the four characteristics of flows in the
# atmosphere (mentioned in [the Introduction](#sec_intro) are also present in
# the Lorenz equations.
#
# Each state in Lorenz’ idealized “climate” is represented by a single
# point in phase space. For a given set of initial conditions, the
# evolution of a trajectory describes how the weather varies in time. The
# butterfly attractor embodies all possible weather conditions that can be
# attained in the Lorenzian climate. By changing the value of the
# parameter $\rho$ (and, for that matter, $\sigma$ or $\beta$), the shape of the
# attractor changes. Physically, we can interpret this as a change in some
# global property of the weather system resulting in a modification of the
# possible weather states.
#
# The same methods of analysis can be applied to more complicated models
# of the weather. One can imagine a model where the depletion of ozone and
# the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere might
# be represented by certain parameters. Changes in these parameters result
# in changes in the shape of the global climate attractor for the system.
# By studying the attractor, we could determine whether any new, and
# possibly devastating, weather states are present in this new
# ozone-deficient atmosphere.
#
# We began by saying in the Introduction that the butterfly effect made
# accurate long-term forecasting impossible. Nevertheless, it is still
# possible to derive meaningful qualitative information from such a
# chaotic dynamical system.

# **Figure: The Lorenzian water wheel.**
#
# Imagine a wheel which is free to rotate about a horizontal axis, as
# depicted in [Figure water-wheel](#fig_water-wheel).
#
#
#
# To the circumference of the wheel is attached a series of leaky buckets.
# Water flows into the buckets at the top of the wheel, and as the buckets
# are filled with water, the wheel becomes unbalanced and begins to
# rotate. Depending on the physical parameters in this system, the wheel
# may remain motionless, rotate steadily in a clockwise or
# counter-clockwise direction, or reverese its motion in irregular
# intervals. This should begin to remind you of the type of behaviour
# exhibited in the Lorenz system for various parameters.
#
# The following are the variables and parameters in the system:
#
# $r$: the radius of the wheel (constant),
#
# $g$: the acceleration due to gravity (constant),
#
# $\theta(t)$: is the angular displacement (not a fixed point on the wheel)
#     (unknown),
#
# $m(\theta,t)$: the mass of the water per unit arc, which we assume is a continuous
#     function of the angle (unknown),
#
# $\Omega(t)$:  the angular velocity of the wheel,
#
# We also make the following assumptions:
#
# -   water is added to the wheel at a constant rate.
#
# -   the points on the circumference of the wheel gain water at a rate
#     proportional to their height.
#
# -   water leaks out at a rate proportional to $m$.
#
# -   there is frictional damping in the wheel proportional to the angular
#     velocity, $k \Omega$,
#
# -   $A$, $B$, $h$ are additional positive constants.
#
# We’ll pass over some details here, and go right to the equations of
# motion. The equation describing the evloution of the angular momentum is
# <!-- \label{lab6:eq:wheel1} -->
#
# $$
# \frac{d\Omega}{dt} = -k \Omega - \left( \frac{gh}{2\pi aA} \right)
#   m \cos\theta.
#  $$ 
#  
#   The requirement of conservation
#   <!--  \label{lab6:eq:wheel2} -->
# of mass in the system leads to two equations
# $$\frac{d (m \sin\theta)}{dt} = \Omega m \cos\theta - h m \sin\theta +
#     2\pi B
# $$ 
# <!-- \label{lab6:eq:wheel3} -->
# and
# $$
# \frac{d (m \cos\theta)}{dt} = -\Omega m \sin\theta - h m \cos\theta,
# $$ 
# (where all variables dependent on the angle
# have been averaged over $\theta$).
#
# Using a suitable change of variables, these three equations
# can be written in the same form as the
# Lorenz equations (with $\beta=1$).
