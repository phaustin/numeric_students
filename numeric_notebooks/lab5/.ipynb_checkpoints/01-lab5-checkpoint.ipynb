    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious that life on earth is highly sensitive to the planet’s\n",
    "atmospheric and climatic conditions. What is less obvious, but of great\n",
    "interest, is the role biology plays in the sensitivity of the climate.\n",
    "This is dramatically illustrated by the concern over the possible\n",
    "contribution to global warming by the loss of the rain forests in\n",
    "Brazil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that each may affect the other implies that the climate and\n",
    "life on earth are interlocked in a complex series of feedbacks, i.e. the\n",
    "climate affects the biosphere which, when altered, then changes the\n",
    "climate and so on. A fascinating question arises as to whether or not\n",
    "this would eventually lead to a stable climate. This scenerio is\n",
    "exploited to its fullest in the <span>*Gaia*</span> hypothesis which\n",
    "postulates that the biosphere, atmosphere, ocean and land are all part\n",
    "of some totality, dubbed <span>*Gaia*</span>, which is essentially an\n",
    "elaborate feedback system which optimizes the conditions of life here on\n",
    "earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be hopeless to attempt to mathematically model such a large,\n",
    "complex system. What can be done instead is to construct a ’toy model’\n",
    "of the system in which much of the complexity has been stripped away and\n",
    "only some of the relevant characteristics retained. The resulting system\n",
    "will then be tractable but, unfortunately, may bear little connection\n",
    "with the original physical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daisyworld is such a model. Life on Daisyworld has been reduced to just\n",
    "two species of daisies of different colors. The only environmental\n",
    "condition that affects the daisy growth rate is temperature. The\n",
    "temperature in turn is modified by the varying amounts of radiation\n",
    "absorbed by the daisies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daisyworld is obviously a gross simplification of the real earth.\n",
    "However, it does retain the central feature of interest: a feedback loop\n",
    "between the climate and life on the planet. Since the equations\n",
    "governing the system will be correspondingly simplified, it will allow\n",
    "us to investigate under what conditions, if any, that equilibrium is\n",
    "reached. The hope is that this will then gain us some insight into how\n",

    "### Why Adaptive Stepsize? \n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, accuracy increases in Runge-Kutta methods as\n",
    "stepsize decreases. At the same time, the number of function evaluations\n",
    "performed increases. This tradeoff between accuracy of the solution and\n",
    "computational cost always exists, but in the ODE solution algorithms\n",
    "presented earlier it often appears to be unnecessarily large. To see\n",
    "this, consider the solution to a problem in two different time\n",
    "intervals. In the first one, the solution is close to steady, whereas in\n",
    "the second one it changes quickly. For acceptable accuracy with a\n",
    "non-adaptive method the step size will have to be adjusted so that the\n",
    "approximate solution is close to the actual solution in the second\n",
    "interval. The stepsize will be fairly small, so that the approximate\n",
    "solution is able to follow the changes in the solution here. However, as\n",
    "there is no change in stepsize throughout the solution process, the same\n",
    "step size will be applied to approximate the solution in the first time\n",
    "interval, where clearly a much larger stepsize would suffice to achieve\n",
    "the same accuracy. Thus, in a region where the solution behaves nicely a\n",
    "lot of function evaluations are wasted because the stepsize is chosen in\n",
    "accordance with the most quickly changing part of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to address this problem is the use of adaptive stepsize control.\n",
    "This class of algorithms adjusts the stepsize taken in a time interval\n",

    "it. As mentioned above, an adaptive algorithm is usually asked to solve\n",
    "a problem to a desired accuracy. To be able to adjust the stepsize in\n",
    "Runge-Kutta the algorithm must therefore calculate some estimate of how\n",

    "How expensive is this method to estimate the error? A single step of\n",
    "fourth order Runge-Kutta always takes four function evaluations. As the\n",
    "second time the step is taken in half-steps, it will take 8 evaluations.\n",
    "However, the first function evaluation in taking a step twice is\n",
    "identical to both steps, and thus the overall cost for one step with\n",
    "step doubling is $12 - 1 = 11$ function evaluations. This should be\n",
    "compared to taking two normal half-steps as this corresponds to the\n",
    "overall accuracy achieved. So we are looking at 3 function evaluations\n",
    "more per step, or an increase of computational cost by a factor of\n",

    "\n",
    "Black daisies can survive at lower mean temperatures than the white\n",
    "daisies and the reverse is true for white daisies. The end result is\n",
    "that the range of L for which the non-zero daisy steady states exist is\n",
    "greater than the case of neutral (or no) daisies . In other words, the\n",
    "feedback from the daisies provide a stabilizing effect that extends the\n",
    "set of environmental conditions in which life on Daisyworld can exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"prob_predator\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Predator**: To make life a little more interesting on\n",
    "Daisyworld, add a population of rabbits that feed upon the daisies. The\n",
    "rabbit birth rate will be proportional to the area covered by the\n",
    "daisies while, conversely, the daisy *death rate* will be\n",
    "proportional to the rabbit population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add another equation to the Daisyworld model which governs the rabbit\n",
    "population and make the appropriate modifications to the existing daisy\n",
    "equations. Modify the set of equations and solve it with the Runge-Kutta\n",
    "method with adaptive timesteps. Use it to look for steady states and to\n",
    "determine their dependence on the initial conditions and model\n",
    "parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hand in notebook cells that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Show your modified Daisyworld equations and your new integrator class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  At least one set of parameter values and initial conditions that\n",
    "    leads to the steady state and a plot of the timeseries for the daisies and rabbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  A discussion of the steady state’s dependence on these values, i.e.\n",
    "    what happens when they are altered. Include a few plots for\n",
    "    illustration.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.  Does adding this feedback extend the range of habital L values  for which\n",
    "    non-zero populations exist?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus:**: Now consider foxes that prey on rabbits but\n",
    "leave the daisies alone."
