 The third row has the most zero entries, so the matrix will
be multiplied about this row to find the determinant.  The reason for
choosing this row will become clear below. <BR>
<P>
 To find the determinant, you need to first find the
components that make up the determinant of the matrix.  For each
element <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img2.gif"> in the chosen row i of a <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img3.gif"> matrix,
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img4.gif"> is multiplied by the determinant of the matrix without the
row i and the column j i.e. an <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img5.gif"> matrix.  <BR>
<P>
 In this case, the first element is -1, and the <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img6.gif"> matrix is the original matrix without row 3 and column 1:
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img7.gif"><P>
<P>
 This is the first component for calculating det(A).
<P>
The other components are derived the same way:
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img8.gif"><P>
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img9.gif"><P>
<P>
 Before adding the components together to find the
determinant, there is one extra factor that is necessary.  Each
component has to be multiplied by the number <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img10.gif">, where i and
j are the row and column, respectively, that contain the element from
the chosen row. <BR>
<P>
 So when everything is put together:
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img11.gif"><P>
<P>
 So <b>A</b> has an inverse.
<P>
 Note that since two of the elements in row three are 0, in calculating the determinant, two of the components can easily be removed, because they are 0.
<P>

<LI> Given
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img12.gif"><P>
<P>
 The third row should be chosen since it has the most zero
entries.  In the same way as the previous question, the various
components are derived, so:
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img13.gif"><P>
<P>
 <b>B</b> is singular, i.e. it does not have an inverse.
<P>

<LI> Given
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img14.gif"><P>
 With Octave, <BR>
<P>
octave:1<b>&gt;</b> C = [4 -2 -7 6; -3 0 1 0; -1 -1 5 -1; 0 1 -5 3]  <BR> 
octave:2<b>&gt;</b> det(C) <BR> <BR>
<P>
 you should get <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img15.gif"> = -82 .  <b>C</b> is non-singular, since its determinant is not zero.  So it has an inverse.
